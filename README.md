# Sentiment_Analysis_Using_Logistic_Regression


Sentiment Analysis is the most common text classification tool that analyses an incoming message and tells whether the underlying sentiment is positive, negative our neutral. 

How does sentiment Analysis work?
Basic sentiment analysis of text documents follows a straightforward process:

* Break each text document down into its component parts (sentences, phrases, tokens and parts of speech)
* Identify each sentiment-bearing phrase and component
* Assign a sentiment score to each phrase and component (-1 to +1)
* Optional: Combine scores for multi-layered sentiment analysis
